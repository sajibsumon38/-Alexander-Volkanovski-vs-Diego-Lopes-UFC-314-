# -Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-UFC-314-

April 12, 202‘5, Kaseya Center, Miami It will be contested for the vacant UFC featherweight title, as Ilia Topuria relinquished the belt to ascend to lightweight. This is an important fight for both fighters, as Volkanovski attempts to find his former glory while Lopes looks for his first UFC title.
Alexander Volkanovski's
Record: Volkanovski (26-4) is a former UFC featherweight titleholder who reigned over the weight class for more than four years and defended his belt five times. But he is coming off two consecutive knockout defeats — first to Islam Makhachev in October 2024 at lightweight, then to Ilia Topuria in February 2024 at featherweight. Following a 14-month layoff, this will be his first fight in more than a year.
Motivation: Volkanovski is 36 years old and he understands that this may be his last opportunity to win the title back. He adopted an “Old Man Volk” persona, wanting to show he could still hang at the highest level. Though younger opponents have come after his place, he feels he is experienced and tactical enough to outlast them.
Diego Lopes' Rise
Record and Momentum: Lopes (26-6) is on a five-fight winning streak, having beaten Dan Ige and Brian Ortega, among others. With an aggressive style and knockout power, Lopes is quickly rising in the featherweight division after debuting in the UFC just under two years ago.
Fighting Style: Lopes is a brutal striker in combination with elite jiu-jitsu so expect Lopes to be a threat on the feet and on the ground. However, questions about his cardio have ever been a concern, although he showed improvement in his last few fights.
Victory
For Volkanovski: Analysts agree that Volkanovski will have to use his footwork and tactical game plan to chip away at Lopes cardio. Not allowing early exchanges, where Lopes is at his most dangerous, will be vital, as Volkanovski’s durability has been called into question following back-to-back knockout defeats.
For Lopes: Lopes needs to build on Volkanovski’s recent trends and put the pressure on early and try to find his power. His ability to blend striking and grappling might prove a challenge for Volkanovski as well.

Betting Odds
Volkanovski comes in as a small favorite despite recent defeats, coming at odds of -150 ($1.67) and Lopes a +105 ($2.20) dog. Analysts believe this is a turn of the fight with serious ramifications for both fighters’ careers.
This fight boils down to an era versus an era: the experience and legacy of Volkanovski against the youthful momentum and gold-seeking hunger of Lopes. The winner will be crowned as the next featherweight champion, and perhaps mark a pivotal moment in the future trajectory of both fighters' careers.
